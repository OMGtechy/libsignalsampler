**What you want to do**
Is there an important bit of functionality missing? An option that could be added ... ?

**How you can currently achieve it**
I had to roll my own / use 20 different functions to approximate what I wanted.

**What you would like instead**
Function XYZ could do this amazing thing!

**An example workflow**
For example:
1) Run foobar --amazing-flag
2) Hear strange noise getting closer.
3) Notice velociraptors appearing on screen.

**Desired platform**
- OS (including version):
- Architecture (x86_64, aarch64, ...):

**Extra info**
Anything else you'd like to add?
